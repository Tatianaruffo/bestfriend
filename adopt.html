                <p>
                    Meghan is a 3 year old pit. She is a really lovely girl, always happy to see you and head out on her walks. She is an easy girl to look after and enjoys her exercise.
                    Meghan is clean in her kennel, we think she will get house training very quickly. She is good on the lead when out and about. 
                    <br>
                    Meghan could be rehomed with another dog once they are prepared to go with her playfulness. She is young and likes to have fun.
