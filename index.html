        <P>
            With Lilly, I never feel alone. I know I always have someone waiting for me when I get home from work, someone to lie and watch TV with, and someone to go do all those outdoor adventures I have always so badly wanted to do independently.

            Because of Lilly, i have made a new group of friends through the rescue, have lessened my massive anxiety, and have pushed myself to places i never knew i’d be able to go.
